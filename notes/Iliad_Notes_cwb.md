# Notes on the _Iliad_

## Summary

### Book 1

The Book begins with a proem invoking the Muse, which does not praise heroic deeds or glorious victory, but the wrath (_mēnis_) of Achilles and how it was destructive to the Greeks (Achilles’ own side!) (1.1-1.5). Next comes the starting point of the quarrel (1.6-1.7), followed by the immediate crisis (a plague, 1.8-1.11). Then the narrative begins, with Agamemnon insulting Apollo’s priest, the plague, and Achilles’ calling an assembly to discuss it (1.12-1.58).

Achilles and Agamemnon have a quarrel, and we get to see that there is some long-standing problem between the two. Agamemnon decides to save the army by giving back his prize, but to take Achilles’ to replace her. Athene has to restrain Achilles from killing Agamemnon (1.188-1.222), and old Nestor’s efforts at mediation go nowhere (1.247-1.284). Achilles withdraws from the war and arranges for his goddess-mother to get Zeus (her dad) to ensure that the Greeks will suffer defeat until his wrath is appeased and he rejoins the fighting.

### Book 2

Recounts the origins of the war, and shows that it is not going well. Agamemnon tests the army by suggesting that they leave; they vote with their feet and are brought back only by Odysseus’ efforts. The poet, with the help of the Muses, recounts the origins of the war, under the pretext of enumerating the ships that sailed to Troy. (This passage, the “Catalogue of Ships”, is really interesting if you pay attention!).

### Book 3

Paris and Menelaus plan to engage in single combat. As Helen watches from the walls and talks to Priam, we get another look back at the origins of the war, and the kidnapping (elopement?) of Paris and Helen.

### Book 4

Human wickedness leads to another insult to the gods, as the Greeks and Trojan break their truce.

### Book 5

Combat. Diomedes, who is the “default hero” in the absence of Achilles, has an _aristeia_, a moment of superhuman warrior awesomeness. This shows us how combat _should be_. We also see Diomedes and Glaucon refuse to fight, showing how civilized warfare should work.

### Book 6

Shows us what is at stake. Hector goes back into the city to find Andromache, his excellent wife. We find out that Achilles has (personally) killed all of Andromaches’ male relatives, but did not dishonor them, going so far as to bury her father with full honors. We also see Hector’s and Andromache’s son, Astyanax, and learn that only Hector can save the city. Hector discusses his concept of “fate”.
