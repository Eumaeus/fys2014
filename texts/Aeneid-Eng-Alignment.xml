                    <l>his heart with dagger pierced, disclosing so</l>

                    <l>Aeneas, thine own brother, voyages on</l>
                    <l>storm-driven, by Juno's causeless enmity.</l>
                    <l>Thou knowest it well, and oft hast sighed to see</l>
                    <l>my sighs and tears. Dido the Tyrian now</l>
                    <l>detains him with soft speeches; and I fear</l>
                    <l>such courtesy from Juno means us ill;</l>
                    <l>she is not one who, when the hour is ripe,</l>
                    <l>bids action pause. I therefore now intend</l>
                    <l>the Tyrian Queen to snare, and siege her breast</l>
                    <l>with our invading fire, before some god</l>
                    <l>shall change her mood. But let her bosom burn</l>
                    <l>with love of my Aeneas not less than mine.</l>
                    <l>This thou canst bring to pass. I pray thee hear</l>
                    <l>the plan I counsel. At his father's call</l>
                    <l>Ascanius, heir of kings, makes haste to climb</l>
                    <l>to yon Sidonian citadel; my grace</l>
                    <l>protects him, and he bears gifts which were saved</l>

                    <l>thenceforth, I say, the courage of the Greeks</l>

                    <l>and favoring Pallas all her grace withdrew.</l>
                    <l>No dubious sign she gave. Scarce had they set</l>

                    <l>prodigious trembling of her lance and shield.</l>
                    <l>The prophet Calchas bade us straightway take</l>
                    <l>swift flight across the sea; for fate had willed</l>

                    <l>yon image of the horse, to expiate</l>
                    <l>the woeful sacrilege. Calchas ordained</l>
                    <l>that they should build a thing of monstrous size</l>
                    <l>of jointed beams, and rear it heavenward,</l>
                    <l>so might it never pass your gates, nor come</l>

                    <milestone unit="card"/>
                    <l>But now a vaster spectacle of fear</l>
                    <l>burst over us, to vex our startled souls.</l>
                    <l>Laocoon, that day by cast of lot</l>
                    <l>priest unto Neptune, was in act to slay</l>
                    <l>a huge bull at the god's appointed fane.</l>
                    <l>Lo! o'er the tranquil deep from Tenedos</l>
                    <l>appeared a pair (I shudder as I tell)</l>
                    <l>of vastly coiling serpents, side by side,</l>
                    <l>stretching along the waves, and to the shore</l>
                    <l>taking swift course; their necks were lifted high,</l>
                    <l>their gory dragon-crests o'ertopped the waves;</l>
                    <l>all else, half seen, trailed low along the sea;</l>
                    <l>while with loud cleavage of the foaming brine</l>
                    <l>their monstrous backs wound forward fold on fold.</l>
                    <l>Soon they made land; the furious bright eyes</l>
                    <l>glowed with ensanguined fire; their quivering tongues</l>
                    <l>lapped hungrily the hissing, gruesome jaws.</l>
                    <l>All terror-pale we fled. Unswerving then</l>
                    <l>the monsters to Laocoon made way.</l>
                    <l>First round the tender limbs of his two sons</l>
                    <l>each dragon coiled, and on the shrinking flesh</l>
                    <l>fixed fast and fed. Then seized they on the sire,</l>
                    <l>who flew to aid, a javelin in his hand,</l>
                    <l>embracing close in bondage serpentine</l>
                    <l>twice round the waist; and twice in scaly grasp</l>
                    <l>around his neck, and o'er him grimly peered</l>
                    <l>with lifted head and crest; he, all the while,</l>
                    <l>his holy fillet fouled with venomous blood,</l>
                    <l>tore at his fetters with a desperate hand,</l>
                    <l>and lifted up such agonizing voice,</l>
                    <l>as when a bull, death-wounded, seeks to flee</l>
                    <l>the sacrificial altar, and thrusts back</l>
                    <l>from his doomed head the ill-aimed, glancing blade.</l>
                    <l>then swiftly writhed the dragon-pair away</l>
                    <l>unto the templed height, and in the shrine</l>
                    <l>of cruel Pallas sure asylum found</l>
                    <l>beneath the goddess' feet and orbed shield.</l>
                    <l>Such trembling horror as we ne'er had known</l>
                    <l>seized now on every heart.  Of his vast guilt</l>
                    <l>Laocoon, they say, receives reward;</l>
                    <l>for he with most abominable spear</l>
                    <l>did strike and violate that blessed wood.</l>
                    <l>Yon statue to the temple! Ask the grace</l>

                    <l>which were the kingdom's stay. Ye offer aid</l>
                    <l>unto your country's ashes. Let us fight</l>
                    <l>unto the death! To arms, my men, to arms!</l>
                    <l>The single hope and stay of desperate men</l>

                    <l>Then like the ravening wolves, some night of cloud,</l>
                    <l>when cruel hunger in an empty maw</l>
                    <l>drives them forth furious, and their whelps behind</l>
                    <l>wait famine-throated; so through foemen's steel</l>
                    <l>we flew to surest death, and kept our way</l>
                    <l>straight through the midmost town . The wings of night</l>
                    <l>brooded above us in vast vault of shade.</l>

                    <l>The ancient City fell, whose throne had stood</l>

                    <l>the unresisting dead; at household shrines</l>
                    <l>and by the temples of the gods they lay.</l>
                    <l>Yet not alone was Teucrian blood required:</l>
                    <l>oft out of vanquished hearts fresh valor flamed,</l>
                    <l>and the Greek victor fell. Anguish and woe</l>
                    <l>were everywhere; pale terrors ranged abroad,</l>

                    <l>into a foeman's snare; struck dumb was he</l>
                    <l>and stopped both word and motion; as one steps,</l>

                    <l>had whelmed them quite, we swiftly laid them low.</l>

                    <l>shattered, and in his very hearth and home</l>
                    <l>th' exulting foe, the aged King did bind</l>
                    <l>his rusted armor to his trembling thews,</l>
                    <l>all vainly, and a useless blade of steel</l>
                    <l>he girded on; then charged, resolved to die</l>
                    <l>encircled by the foe. Within his walls</l>
                    <l>there stood, beneath the wide and open sky,</l>
                    <l>a lofty altar; an old laurel-tree</l>
                    <l>leaned o'er it, and enclasped in holy shade</l>
                    <l>the statues of the tutelary powers.</l>
                    <l>Here Hecuba and all the princesses</l>
                    <l>took refuge vain within the place of prayer.</l>
                    <l>Like panic-stricken doves in some dark storm,</l>
                    <l>close-gathering they sate, and in despair</l>
                    <l>embraced their graven gods. But when the Queen</l>
                    <l>saw Priam with his youthful harness on, </l>
                    <l>What frenzy, O my wretched lord, she cried,</l>
                    <l>Arrayed thee in such arms? O, whither now?</l>
                    <l>Not such defences, nor such arm as thine,</l>
                    <l>the time requires, though thy companion were</l>
                    <l>our Hector's self. O, yield thee, I implore!</l>
                    <l>This altar now shall save us one and all,</l>
                    <l>or we must die together. With these words</l>
                    <l>she drew him to her side, and near the shrine</l>
                    <l>made for her aged spouse a place to cling.</l>

                    <l>But, lo! just 'scaped of Pyrrhus' murderous hand,</l>
                    <l>Polites, one of Priam's sons, fled fast</l>
                    <l>along the corridors, through thronging foes</l>
                    <l>and a thick rain of spears. Wildly he gazed</l>
                    <l>across the desolate halls, wounded to death.</l>
                    <l>Fierce Pyrrhus followed after, pressing hard</l>
                    <l>with mortal stroke, and now his hand and spear</l>
                    <l>were close upon: when the lost youth leaped forth</l>
                    <l>into his father's sight, and prostrate there</l>
                    <l>lay dying, while his life-blood ebbed away.</l>
                    <l>Then Priam, though on all sides death was nigh,</l>
                    <l>quit not the strife, nor from loud wrath refrained:</l>
                    <l>Thy crime and impious outrage, may the gods</l>
                    <l>(if Heaven to mortals render debt and due)</l>
                    <l>justly reward and worthy honors pay!</l>
                    <l>My own son's murder thou hast made me see,</l>
                    <l>blood and pollution impiously throwing</l>
                    <l>upon a father's head. Not such was he,</l>
                    <l>not such, Achilles, thy pretended sire,</l>
                    <l>when Priam was his foe. With flush of shame</l>
                    <l>he nobly listened to a suppliant's plea</l>
                    <l>in honor made. He rendered to the tomb</l>
                    <l>my Hector's body pale, and me did send</l>
                    <l>back to my throne a king. With this proud word</l>
                    <l>the aged warrior hurled with nerveless arm</l>
                    <l>his ineffectual spear, which hoarsely rang</l>
                    <l>rebounding on the brazen shield, and hung</l>
                    <l>piercing the midmost boss,- but all in vain.</l>
                    <l>Then Pyrrhus: Take these tidings, and convey</l>
                    <l>message to my father, Peleus' son!</l>
                    <l>tell him my naughty deeds! Be sure and say</l>
                    <l>how Neoptolemus hath shamed his sires.</l>
                    <l>Now die! With this, he trailed before the shrines</l>

                    <l>of his son's blood. Then Pyrrhus' left hand clutched</l>
                    <l>the tresses old and gray; a glittering sword</l>
                    <l>his right hand lifted high, and buried it</l>
                    <l>far as the hilt in that defenceless heart.</l>

                    <l>Didst thou, dear father, dream that I could fly</l>
                    <l>sundered from thee? Did such an infamy</l>
                    <l>fall from a father's lips? If Heaven's decree</l>
                    <l>will of this mighty nation not let live</l>
                    <l>a single soul, if thine own purpose be</l>
                    <l>to cast thyself and thy posterity</l>
                    <l>into thy country's grave, behold, the door</l>
                    <l>is open to thy death! Lo, Pyrrhus comes</l>
                    <l>red-handed from King Priam! He has slain</l>
                    <l>a son before a father's eyes, and spilt</l>
                    <l>a father's blood upon his own hearthstone.</l>
                    <l>Was it for this, O heavenly mother mine,</l>
                    <l>that thou hast brought me safe through sword and fire?</l>
                    <l>that I might see these altars desecrate</l>
                    <l>by their worst foes? that I might look upon</l>
                    <l>my sire, my wife, and sweet Ascanius</l>

                    <l>So saying, I bowed my neck and shoulders broad,</l>
                    <l>o'erspread me with a lion's tawny skin,</l>
                    <l>and lifted up my load. Close at my side</l>

                    <l>my father peered, and shouted, O my son,</l>
                    <l>away, away! for surely all our foes</l>

                    <l>each mantled head; and from my body ran</l>

                    <l>He owned our stock two-branched, of our great sires</l>

                    <l>I mind me now that her wild tongue foretold</l>

                    <l>storm-laden, dark as night, and every wave</l>

                    <l>the wreckful surges rose; our ships were hurled</l>
                    <l>wide o'er the whirling waters; thunder-clouds</l>
                    <l>and misty murk of night made end of all</l>

                    <l>flashed with the oft-reiterate shaft of Jove.</l>
                    <l>Then went we drifting, beaten from our course,</l>
                    <l>upon a trackless sea. Not even the eyes</l>
                    <l>of Palinurus could tell night from noon</l>
                    <l>or ken our way. Three days of blinding dark,</l>
                    <l>three nights without a star, we roved the seas;</l>
                    <l>The fourth, land seemed to rise. Far distant hills</l>
                    <l>and rolling smoke we saw. Down came our sails,</l>
                    <l>out flew the oars, and with prompt stroke the crews</l>
                    <l>swept the dark waves and tossed the crested foam.</l>
                    <l>From such sea-peril safe, I made the shores</l>
                    <l>of Strophades,a name the Grecians gave</l>
                    <l>to islands in the broad Ionic main, </l>

                    <l>fled from the routed feast; no prodigy</l>
                    <l>more vile than these, nor plague more pitiless</l>
                    <l>ere rose by wrath divine from Stygian wave;</l>
                    <l>birds seem they, but with face like woman-kind;</l>
                    <l>foul-flowing bellies, hands with crooked claws,</l>
                    <l>and ghastly lips they have, with hunger pale.</l>
                    <l>Scarce had we made the haven, when, behold!</l>
                    <l>Fair herds of cattle roaming a wide plain,</l>
                    <l>and horned goats, untended, feeding free</l>
                    <l>in pastures green, surprised our happy eyes.</l>
                    <l>with eager blades we ran to take and slay,</l>
                    <l>asking of every god, and chicfly Jove,</l>
                    <l>to share the welcome prize: we ranged a feast,</l>
                    <l>with turf-built couches and a banquet-board</l>
                    <l>along the curving strand. But in a trice,</l>
                    <l>down from the high hills swooping horribly,</l>
                    <l>the Harpies loudly shrieking, flapped their wings,</l>
                    <l>snatched at our meats, and with infectious touch</l>
                    <l>polluted all; infernal was their cry,</l>
                    <l>the stench most vile. Once more in covert far</l>
                    <l>beneath a caverned rock, and close concealed</l>
                    <l>with trees and branching shade, we raised aloft</l>
                    <l>our tables, altars, and rekindled fires.</l>
                    <l>Once more from haunts unknown the clamorous flock</l>
                    <l>from every quarter flew, and seized its prey</l>
                    <l>with taloned feet and carrion lip most foul.</l>
                    <l>I called my mates to arms and opened war</l>
                    <l>on that accursed brood. My band obeyed;</l>
                    <l>and, hiding in deep grass their swords and shields,</l>
                    <l>in ambush lay. But presently the foe</l>
                    <l>swept o'er the winding shore with loud alarm :</l>
                    <l>then from a sentry-crag, Misenus blew</l>
                    <l>a signal on his hollow horn. My men</l>
                    <l>flew to the combat strange, and fain would wound</l>
                    <l>with martial steel those foul birds of the sea;</l>
                    <l>but on their sides no wounding blade could fall,</l>
                    <l>nor any plume be marred. In swiftest flight</l>
                    <l>to starry skies they soared, and left on earth</l>
                    <l>their half-gnawed, stolen feast, and footprints foul.</l>
                    <l>Celaeno only on a beetling crag</l>
                    <l>took lofty perch, and, prophetess of ill,</l>
                    <l>shrieked malediction from her vulture breast:</l>

                    <l>I hung for trophy on that temple door</l>
                    <l>a swelling shield of brass (which once was worn</l>

                    <l>of strange vicissitude. So up I climbed,</l>
                    <l>leaving the haven, fleet, and friendly shore.</l>
                    <l>That self-same hour outside the city walls,</l>
                    <l>within a grove where flowed the mimic stream</l>
                    <l>of a new Simois, Andromache,</l>
                    <l>with offerings to the dead, and gifts of woe,</l>
                    <l>poured forth libation, and invoked the shade</l>
                    <l>of Hector, at a tomb which her fond grief</l>
                    <l>had consecrated to perpetual tears,</l>
                    <l>though void; a mound of fair green turf it stood,</l>
                    <l>and near it rose twin altars to his name.</l>
                    <l>She saw me drawing near; our Trojan helms</l>

                    <l>at the portentous sight, she swooning fell</l>
                    <l>and lay cold, rigid, lifeless, till at last,</l>
                    <l>scarce finding voice, her lips addressed me thus :</l>

                    <l>with broken voice and accents faltering:</l>

                    <l>Thus poured she forth full many a doleful word</l>

                    <l>Then to the prophet-priest I made this prayer:</l>

                    <l>to starboard, we? Keep her head round this way!</l>
                    <l>Hug shore! Let every oar-blade almost graze</l>
                    <l>that reef to larboard! Let the others take</l>
                    <l>the deep-sea course outside! But while he spoke,</l>
                    <l>Menoetes, dreading unknown rocks below,</l>
                    <l>veered off to open sea. Why steer so wide?</l>
                    <l>Round to the rock, Menoetes! Gyas roared, </l>
                    <l>again in vain, for looking back he saw</l>
                    <l>cloanthus hard astern, and ever nearer,</l>
                    <l>who, in a trice, betwixt the booming reef</l>
                    <l>and Gyas' galley, lightly forward thrust</l>
                    <l>the beak of Scylla to the inside course,</l>
                    <l>and, quickly taking lead, flew past the goal</l>
                    <l>to the smooth seas beyond. Then wrathful grief</l>
                    <l>flamed in the warrior's heart, nor was his cheek</l>
                    <l>unwet with tears; and, reckless utterly</l>
                    <l>of his own honor and his comrades, lives,</l>
                    <l>he hurled poor, slack Menoetes from the poop</l>
                    <l>headlong upon the waters, while himself,</l>
                    <l>pilot and master both, the helm assuming,</l>
                    <l>urged on his crew, and landward took his way.</l>
                    <l>But now, with heavy limbs that hardly won</l>
                    <l>his rescue from the deep, engulfing wave,</l>
                    <l>up the rude rock graybeard Menoetes climbed</l>
                    <l>with garment dripping wet, and there dropped down</l>
                    <l>upon the cliff's dry top. With laughter loud</l>
                    <l>the Trojan crews had watched him plunging, swimming,</l>
                    <l>and now to see his drink of bitter brine</l>
                    <l>spewed on the ground, the sailors laughed again.</l>

                    <l>But Mnestheus and Sergestus, coming last,</l>
                    <l>have joyful hope enkindled in each heart</l>
                    <l>to pass the laggard Gyas. In the lead</l>
                    <l>Sergestus' ship shoots forth; and to the rock</l>
                    <l>runs boldly nigh; but not his whole long keel</l>
                    <l>may pass his rival; the projecting beak</l>
                    <l>is followed fast by Pristis' emulous prow.</l>
                    <l>Then, striding straight amidships through his crew,</l>
                    <l>thus Mnestheus urged them on: O Hector's friends!</l>
                    <l>Whom in the dying hours of <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName> I
                        chose</l>
                    <l>for followers! Now stand ye to your best!</l>
                    <l>Put forth the thews of valor that ye showed</l>
                    <l>in the Gaetulian Syrtes, or that sea</l>
                    <l>Ionian, or where the waves race by</l>
                    <l>the Malean promontory! Mnestheus now</l>
                    <l>hopes not to be the first, nor do I strive</l>
                    <l>for victory. O Father Neptune, give</l>
                    <l>that garland where thou wilt! But O, the shame</l>
                    <l>if we are last! Endure it not, my men!</l>
                    <l>The infamy refuse! So, bending low,</l>
                    <l>they enter the home-stretch. Beneath their stroke</l>
                    <l>the brass-decked galley throbs, and under her</l>
                    <l>the sea-floor drops away. On, on they fly!</l>
                    <l>Parched are the panting lips, and sweat in streams</l>
                    <l>pours down their giant sides; but lucky chance</l>
                    <l>brought the proud heroes what their honor craved.</l>
                    <l>For while Sergestus furiously drove</l>
                    <l>his ship's beak toward the rock, and kept inside</l>
                    <l>the scanty passage, by his evil star</l>
                    <l>he grounded on the jutting reef; the cliffs</l>
                    <l>rang with the blow, and his entangled oars</l>
                    <l>grated along the jagged granite, while</l>
                    <l>the prow hung wrecked and helpless. With loud cry</l>
                    <l>upsprang the sailors, while the ship stood still,</l>
                    <l>and pushed off with long poles and pointed iron,</l>
                    <l>or snatched the smashed oars from the whirling tide.</l>
                    <l>Mnestheus exults; and, roused to keener strife</l>
                    <l>by happy fortune, with a quicker stroke</l>
                    <l>of each bright rank of oars, and with the breeze</l>
                    <l>his prayer implored, skims o'er the obedient wave</l>
                    <l>and sweeps the level main. Not otherwise</l>
                    <l>a startled dove, emerging o'er the fields</l>
                    <l>from secret cavern in the crannied hill</l>
                    <l>where her safe house and pretty nestlings lie,</l>

                    <l>through the still sky she takes her path of air</l>
                    <l>on pinions motionless. So Pristis sped</l>
                    <l>with Mnestheus, cleaving her last stretch of sea,</l>
                    <l>by her own impulse wafted. She outstripped</l>
                    <l>Sergestus first; for he upon the reef</l>
                    <l>fought with the breakers, desperately shouting</l>
                    <l>for help, for help in vain, with broken oars</l>
                    <l>contriving to move on. Then Mnestheus ran</l>
                    <l>past Gyas, in Chimaera's ponderous hulk,</l>

                    <l>left of his many lost, comes crawling in</l>

                    <l>came third; him Helymus was hard upon;</l>
                    <l>and, look! Diores follows, heel on heel,</l>
                    <l>close at his shoulderif the race be long</l>
                    <l>he sure must win, or claim a doubtful prize.</l>
                    <l>Now at the last stretch, spent and panting, all</l>
                    <l>pressed to the goal, when in a slime of blood</l>
                    <l>Nisus, hard fate! slipped down, where late the death</l>
                    <l>of victims slain had drenched the turf below.</l>
                    <l>Here the young victor, with his triumph flushed,</l>
                    <l>lost foothold on the yielding ground, and plunged</l>
                    <l>face forward in the pool of filth and gore;</l>
                    <l>but not of dear Euryalus was he</l>
                    <l>forgetful then, nor heedless of his friend;</l>
                    <l>but rising from the mire he hurled himself</l>
                    <l>in Salius' way; so he in equal plight</l>
                    <l>rolled in the filthy slough. Euryalus</l>
                    <l>leaped forth, the winner of the race by gift</l>
                    <l>of his true friend, and flying to the goal</l>
                    <l>stood first, by many a favoring shout acclaimed.</l>
                    <l>Next Helymus ran in; and, for the third, last prize,</l>
                    <l>Diores. But the multitude now heard</l>
                    <l>the hollowed hill-side ringing with wild wrath</l>
                    <l>from Salius, clamoring where the chieftains sate</l>
                    <l>for restitution of his stolen prize,</l>
                    <l>lost by a cheat. But general favor smiles</l>
                    <l>upon Euryalus, whose beauteous tears</l>
                    <l>commend him much, and nobler seems the worth</l>
                    <l>of valor clothed in youthful shape so fair.</l>
                    <l>Diores, too, assists the victor's claim,</l>
                    <l>with loud appealhe too has won a prize,</l>
                    <l>and vainly holds his last place, if the first</l>
                    <l>to Salius fall. </l>

                    <l>None can re-judge the prize. But to console</l>
                    <l>the misadventure of a blameless friend,</l>

                    <l>with ponderous mane, the claws o'erlaid with gold.</l>
                    <l>But Nisus cried: If such a gift be found</l>
                    <l>for less than victory, and men who fall</l>
                    <l>are worthy so much sorrow, pray, what prize</l>

                    <l>was pieced with lead and iron. Dares stared</l>
                    <l>astonished, and step after step recoiled;</l>
                    <l>high-souled Anchises' son, this way and that,</l>

                    <l>then with a deep-drawn breath the veteran spoke:</l>
                    <l>O, that thy wondering eyes had seen the arms</l>
                    <l>of Hercules, and what his gauntlets were!</l>
                    <l>Would thou hadst seen the conflict terrible</l>
                    <l>upon this self-same shore! These arms were borne</l>

                    <l>shed frost upon my brows. But if these arms</l>

                    <l>and towered gigantic in the midmost ring.</l>
                    <l>Anchises' son then gave two equal pairs</l>
                    <l>of gauntlets, and accoutred with like arms</l>
                    <l>both champions. Each lifted him full height</l>

                    <l>held both fists high in air, and drew his head</l>
                    <l>far back from blows assailing. Then they joined</l>
                    <l>in struggle hand to hand, and made the fray</l>
                    <l>each moment fiercer. One was light of foot</l>
                    <l>and on his youth relied; the other strong</l>
                    <l>in bulk of every limb, but tottering</l>
                    <l>on sluggish knees, while all his body shook</l>
                    <l>with labor of his breath. Without avail</l>
                    <l>they rained their blows, and on each hollow side,</l>
                    <l>each sounding chest, the swift, reverberate strokes</l>
                    <l>fell without pause; around their ears and brows</l>
                    <l>came blow on blow, and with relentless shocks</l>
                    <l>the smitten jaws cracked loud. Entellus stands</l>

                    <l>only by body-movement or quick eye</l>
                    <l>parries attack. Dares (like one in siege</l>

                    <l>Then, rising to the stroke, Entellus poised</l>
                    <l>aloft his ponderous right; but, quick of eye,</l>
                    <l>the other the descending wrath foresaw</l>
                    <l>and nimbly slipped away; Entellus so</l>
                    <l>wasted his stroke on air, and, self-o'erthrown,</l>
                    <l>dropped prone to earth his monstrous length along,</l>
                    <l>as when on Erymanth or Ida falls</l>

                    <l>rushed fiercer to the fight, his strength now roused</l>
                    <l>by rage, while shame and courage confident</l>

                    <l>Dares full speed all round the ring, with blows</l>
                    <l>redoubled right and left. No stop or stay</l>
                    <l>gives he, but like a storm of rattling hail</l>
                    <l>upon a house-top, so from each huge hand</l>

                    <l>Then Sire Aeneas willed to make a stay</l>

                    <l>flame beyond bound, but bade the battle pause,</l>
                    <l>and, rescuing weary Dares, thus he spoke</l>

                    <l>is in thy mind? Will not thy heart confess</l>
                    <l>thy strength surpassed, and auspices averse?</l>
                    <l>Submit, for Heaven decrees! With such wise words</l>

                    <l>of dewy Night drew near the turning-point</l>

                    <l>Then from the high stars on light-moving wings,</l>
                    <l>the God of Sleep found passage through the dark</l>
                    <l>and clove the gloom,to bring upon thy head,</l>
                    <l>O Palinurus, an ill-boding sleep,</l>

                    <l>in guise of Phorbas stood, thus whispering:</l>
                    <l>Look, Palinurus, how the flowing tides</l>

                    <l>But Palinurus, lifting scarce his eyes,</l>
                    <l>thus answered him: Have I not known the face</l>

                    <l>more firmly, fixing on the stars his eyes.</l>
                    <l>Then waved the god above his brows a branch</l>
                    <l>wet with the dews of Lethe and imbued</l>
                    <l>with power of Stygian dark, until his eyes</l>

                    <l>Who watched them through still groves approach his shore,</l>
                    <l>Hailed them, at distance, from the Stygian wave,</l>
                    <l>And with reproachful summons thus began:</l>
                    <l>Whoe'er thou art that in this warrior guise</l>
                    <l>Unto my river comest,quickly tell</l>
                    <l>Thine errand! Stay thee where thou standest now!</l>
                    <l>This is ghosts' land, for sleep and slumbrous dark.</l>
                    <l>That flesh and blood my Stygian ship should bear</l>
                    <l>Were lawless wrong. Unwillingly I took</l>
                    <l>Alcides, Theseus, and Pirithous,</l>
                    <l>Though sons of gods, too mighty to be quelled.</l>
                    <l>One bound in chains yon warder of Hell's door,</l>
                    <l>And dragged him trembling from our monarch's throne:</l>
                    <l>The others, impious, would steal away</l>
                    <l>Out of her bride-bed Pluto's ravished Queen.</l>
                    <l>Briefly th' Amphrysian priestess made reply:</l>
                    <l>Not ours, such guile: Fear not! This warrior's arms</l>
                    <l>Are innocent. Let Cerberus from his cave</l>
                    <l>Bay ceaselessly, the bloodless shades to scare;</l>
                    <l>Let Proserpine immaculately keep</l>
                    <l>The house and honor of her kinsman King.</l>
                    <l>Trojan Aeneas, famed for faithful prayer</l>
                    <l>And victory in arms, descends to seek</l>
                    <l>His father in this gloomy deep of death.</l>
                    <l>If loyal goodness move not such as thee,</l>
                    <l>This branch at least (she drew it from her breast)</l>
                    <l>Thou knowest well.</l>
                    <l>Then cooled his wrathful heart;</l>
                    <l>With silent lips he looked and wondering eyes</l>
                    <l>Upon that fateful, venerable wand,</l>
                    <l>Seen only once an age. Shoreward he turned,</l>
                    <l>And pushed their way his boat of leaden hue.</l>
                    <l>The rows of crouching ghosts along the thwarts</l>
                    <l>He scattered, cleared a passage, and gave room</l>
                    <l>To great Aeneas. The light shallop groaned</l>
                    <l>Beneath his weight, and, straining at each seam,</l>
                    <l>Took in the foul flood with unstinted flow.</l>
                    <l>At last the hero and his priestess-guide</l>
                    <l>Came safe across the river, and were moored</l>
                    <l>'mid sea-green sedges in the formless mire.</l>

                    <l>Divine decrees compelled me, even as now</l>
                    <l>Among these ghosts I pass, and thread my way</l>
                    <l>Along this gulf of night and loathsome land.</l>
                    <l>How could I deem my cruel taking leave</l>
                    <l>Would bring thee at the last to all this woe?</l>
                    <l>0, stay! Why shun me? Wherefore haste away?</l>

                    <l>Where her first spouse, Sichaeus, with her tears</l>

                    <l>a dwelling and a battlement. Behold!</l>

                    <l>will end our evil days. Up, then! For now</l>
                    <l>by morning's joyful beam we will explore</l>
                    <l>what men, what cities, in this region be,</l>
                    <l>and, leaving ship, our several errands ply.</l>

                    <l>this people to thy side and bind them close</l>
                    <l>in federated power. My channel fair</l>
                    <l>and shaded shore shall guide thee where they dwell,</l>
                    <l>and thy strong oarsmen on my waters borne</l>
                    <l>shall mount my falling stream. Rise, goddess-born,</l>
                    <l>and ere the starlight fade give honor due</l>
                    <l>to Juno, and with supplicating vow</l>
                    <l>avert her wrath and frown. But unto me</l>
                    <l>make offering in thy victorious hour,</l>
                    <l>in time to come. I am the copious flood</l>
                    <l>which thou beholdest chafing at yon shores</l>

                    <l>tumbled and tossed in huge confusion lie!</l>
                    <l>A cavern once it was, which ran deep down</l>
                    <l>into the darkness. There th' half-human shape</l>
                    <l>of Cacus made its hideous den, concealed</l>
                    <l>from sunlight and the day. The ground was wet</l>
                    <l>at all times with fresh gore; the portal grim</l>
                    <l>was hung about with heads of slaughtered men,</l>
                    <l>bloody and palea fearsome sight to see.</l>
                    <l>Vulcan begat this monster, which spewed forth</l>
                    <l>dark-fuming flames from his infernal throat,</l>
                    <l>and vast his stature seemed. But time and tide</l>
                    <l>brought to our prayers the advent of a god</l>
                    <l>to help us at our need. For Hercules,</l>
                    <l>divine avenger, came from laying low</l>
                    <l>three-bodied Geryon, whose spoils he wore</l>
                    <l>exultant, and with hands victorious drove</l>
                    <l>the herd of monster bulls, which pastured free</l>
                    <l>along our river-valley. Cacus gazed</l>
                    <l>in a brute frenzy, and left not untried</l>
                    <l>aught of bold crime or stratagem, but stole</l>
                    <l>four fine bulls as they fed, and heifers four,</l>
                    <l>all matchless; but, lest hoof-tracks point his way,</l>
                    <l>he dragged them cave-wards by the tails, confusing</l>
                    <l>the natural trail, and hid the stolen herd</l>
                    <l>in his dark den; and not a mark or sign</l>
                    <l>could guide the herdsmen to that cavern-door.</l>
                    <l>But after, when Amphitryon's famous son,</l>
                    <l>preparing to depart, would from the meads</l>
                    <l>goad forth the full-fed herd, his lingering bulls</l>
                    <l>roared loud, and by their lamentable cry</l>
                    <l>filled grove and hills with clamor of farewell:</l>
                    <l>one heifer from the mountain-cave lowed back</l>
                    <l>in answer, so from her close-guarded stall</l>
                    <l>foiling the monster's will. </l>

                    <l>the wrath of Hercules in frenzy blaze</l>
                    <l>from his exasperate heart. His arms he seized,</l>

                    <l>the wind-swept hill. Now first our people saw</l>
                    <l>Cacus in fear, with panic in his eyes.</l>
                    <l>Swift to the black cave like a gale he flew,</l>
                    <l>his feet by terror winged. Scarce had he passed</l>
                    <l>the cavern door, and broken the big chains,</l>
                    <l>and dropped the huge rock which was pendent there</l>

                    <l>the guarded gate: when there Tirynthius stood,</l>
                    <l>with heart aflame, surveying each approach,</l>
                    <l>rolling this way and that his wrathful eyes,</l>
                    <l>gnashing his teeth. Three times his ire surveyed</l>
                    <l>the slope of <placeName key="tgn,4012809">Aventine</placeName>; three times
                        he stormed</l>

                    <l>to rest him in the vale. But high above</l>
                    <l>a pointed peak arose, sheer face of rock</l>
                    <l>on every side, which towered into view</l>
                    <l>from the long ridge above the vaulted cave,</l>
                    <l>fit haunt for birds of evil-boding wing.</l>
                    <l>This peak, which leftward toward the river leaned,</l>

                    <l>thrust at it: as he thrust, the thunder-sound</l>
                    <l>filled all the arching sky, the river's banks</l>
                    <l>asunder leaped, and <placeName key="tgn,1130786">Tiber</placeName> in

                    <l>lay shelterless, and naked to the day</l>
                    <l>the gloomy caverns of his vast abode</l>
                    <l>stood open, deeply yawning, just as if</l>

                    <l>of that dread rock and grove. This leafy wood,</l>

                    <l>'Mid such good parley to the house they came</l>
                    <l>of King Evander, unadorned and plain,</l>
                    <l>whence herds of browsing cattle could be seen</l>
                    <l>ranging the Forum, and loud-bellowing</l>
                    <l>in proud Carinae. As they entered there,</l>
                    <l>Behold, said he, the threshold that received</l>
                    <l>Alcides in his triumph! This abode</l>
                    <l>he made his own. Dare, O illustrious guest,</l>

                    <l>to be a god's fit follower. Enter here,</l>
                    <l>and free from pride our frugal welcome share.</l>
                    <l>So saying, 'neath his roof-tree scant and low</l>

                    <l>to adverse, 't is my fondest prayer that thou</l>

                    <l>suit better with more life. Oh! let there be</l>

                    <l>my corpse, recaptured in the desperate fray,</l>
                    <l>or ransomed for a price. Or if this boon</l>

                    <l>then pay the debt of grief and loyal woe</l>
                    <l>unto my far-off dust, and garlands leave</l>
                    <l>upon an empty tomb. No grief I give</l>
                    <l>to any sorrowing mother; one alone,</l>
                    <l>of many Trojan mothers, had the heart</l>
                    <l>to follow thee, her child, and would not stay</l>
                    <l>in great Acestes' land. His friend replied:</l>
                    <l>Thou weavest but a web of empty words</l>
                    <l>and reasons vain, nor dost thou shake at all</l>
                    <l>my heart's resolve. Come, let us haste away!</l>
                    <l>He answered so, and summoned to the gate</l>
                    <l>a neighboring watch, who, bringing prompt relief,</l>
                    <l>the sentry-station took; then quitted he</l>
                    <l>his post assigned; at Nisus' side he strode,</l>

                    <l>saw you that steed of Turnus and the arms</l>

                    <l>and, Nisus, they are thine. Hereto my sire</l>

                    <l>which now Latinus holds. But as for thee,</l>
                    <l>to whom my youth but binds me closer still,</l>
                    <l>thee, kingly boy, my whole heart makes my own,</l>

                    <l>forgetting thee: but trust thee from this day</l>

                    <l>this heart unworthy thy heroic call!</l>
                    <l>And may our fortune ever prosperous prove,</l>
                    <l>not adverse. But I now implore of thee</l>
                    <l>a single boon worth all beside. I have</l>
                    <l>a mother, from the venerated line</l>
                    <l>of Priam sprung, whom not the Trojan shore</l>
                    <l>nor King Acestes' city could detain,</l>
                    <l>alas! from following me. I leave her now</l>
                    <l>without farewell; nor is her love aware</l>
                    <l>of my supposed peril. For I swear</l>
                    <l>by darkness of this night and thy right hand,</l>
                    <l>that all my courage fails me if I see</l>
                    <l>a mother's tears. O, therefore, I implore,</l>
                    <l>be thou her sorrow's comfort and sustain</l>
                    <l>her solitary day. Such grace from thee</l>
                    <l>equip me for my war, and I shall face</l>
                    <l>with braver heart whatever fortune brings.</l>
                    <l>With sudden sorrow thrilled, the veteran lords</l>
                    <l>of Teucria showed their tears. But most of all</l>
                    <l>such likeness of his own heart's filial love</l>
                    <l>on fair Iulus moved, and thus he spoke:</l>
                    <l>Promise thyself what fits thy generous deeds.</l>
                    <l>Thy mother shall be mine, Creusa's name</l>
                    <l>alone not hers; nor is the womb unblest</l>
                    <l>that bore a child like thee. Whate'er success</l>
                    <l>may follow, I make oath immutable</l>
                    <l>by my own head, on which my father swore,</l>
                    <l>that all I promise thee of gift or praise</l>
                    <l>if home thou comest triumphing, shall be</l>
                    <l>the glory of thy mother and thy kin.</l>
                    <l>Weeping he spoke, and from his shoulder drew</l>
                    <l>the golden sword, well-wrought and wonderful,</l>
                    <l>which once in Crete Lycaon's cunning made</l>
                    <l>and sheathed in ivory. On Nisus then</l>
                    <l>Mnestheus bestowed a shaggy mantle torn</l>
                    <l>from a slain lion; good Aletes gave</l>
                    <l>exchange of crested helms. In such array</l>
                    <l>they hastened forth; and all the princely throng,</l>
                    <l>young men and old, ran with them to the gates,</l>
                    <l>praying all gods to bless. Iulus then,</l>
                    <l>a fair youth, but of grave, heroic soul</l>
                    <l>beyond his years, gave them in solemn charge</l>
                    <l>full many a message for his sire, but these</l>
                    <l>the hazard of wild winds soon scattered far,</l>
                    <l>and flung them fruitless on the darkening storm.</l>

                    <l>Forth through the moat they climb, and steal away</l>
                    <l>through midnight shades, to where their foemen lie</l>
                    <l>encamped in arms; of whom, before these fall,</l>
                    <l>a host shall die. Along the turf were seen,</l>
                    <l>laid low in heavy slumber and much wine,</l>
                    <l>a prostrate troop; the horseless chariots</l>
                    <l>stood tilted on the shore, 'twixt rein and wheel</l>
                    <l>the drivers dozed, wine-cups and idle swords</l>
                    <l>strewn round them without heed. The first to speak</l>
                    <l>was Nisus. Look, Euryalus, he cried,</l>
                    <l>Now boldly strike. The hour to do the deed</l>
                    <l>is here, the path this way. Keep wide-eyed watch</l>
                    <l>that no man smite behind us. I myself</l>
                    <l>will mow the mighty fieid, and lead thee on</l>
                    <l>in a wide swath of slaughter. With this word</l>
                    <l>he shut his lips; and hurled him with his sword</l>
                    <l>on haughty Rhamnes, who lay propped at ease</l>
                    <l>on pillows huge, and from his heaving breast</l>
                    <l>poured slumber loud: of royal stem was he</l>
                    <l>and honored of King Turnus for his skill</l>
                    <l>in augury; yet could no augur's charm</l>
                    <l>that bloody stroke forefend. And Nisus slew</l>
                    <l>three slaves near by, that lay in reckless sleep</l>
                    <l>upon their spears; then him that bore the shield</l>
                    <l>of Remus, then the driver of his car</l>
                    <l>close to the horses caught; his sword cut through</l>
                    <l>their prostrate necks; then their great master's head</l>
                    <l>he lifted high, and left decapitate</l>
                    <l>the huge corpse spilling forth its crimson gore</l>
                    <l>o'er couch and ground. Like stroke on Lamus fell</l>
                    <l>and Lamyrus, with young Serranus, who</l>
                    <l>had gamed the midnight through and sleeping lay,</l>
                    <l>his fair young body to the wine-god given;</l>
                    <l>but happier now had that long-revelling night</l>
                    <l>been merry till the dawn! Thus round full folds</l>
                    <l>of sheep a famished lion fiercely prowls;</l>
                    <l>mad hunger moves him; he devours and rends</l>
                    <l>with bloody, roaring mouth, the feeble flock</l>
                    <l>that trembles and is dumb. Nor was the sword</l>
                    <l>of fair Euryalus less fatal found;</l>
                    <l>but fiercely raging on his path of death,</l>
                    <l>he pressed on through a base and nameless throng,</l>
                    <l>Rhoetus, Herbesus, Fadus, Abaris;</l>
                    <l>surprising all save Rhoetus, who awake</l>
                    <l>saw every stroke, and crouched in craven fear</l>
                    <l>behind a mighty wine-bowl; but not less</l>
                    <l>clean through his bare breast as he started forth</l>
                    <l>the youth thrust home his sword, then drew it back</l>
                    <l>death-dripping, while the bursting purple stream</l>
                    <l>of life outflowed, with mingling blood and wine.</l>
                    <l>Then, flushed with stealthy slaughter, he crept near</l>
                    <l>the followers of Messapus, where he saw</l>
                    <l>their camp-fire dying down, and tethered steeds</l>
                    <l>upon the meadow feeding. Nisus then</l>
                    <l>knew the hot lust of slaughter had swept on </l>
                    <l>too far, and cried, Hold off! For, lo,</l>
                    <l>the monitory dawn is nigh. Revenge</l>
                    <l>has fed us to the full. We have achieved</l>
                    <l>clean passage through the foe. Full many a prize</l>
                    <l>was left untaken: princely suits of mail</l>
                    <l>enwrought with silver pure, huge drinking-bowls,</l>
                    <l>and broideries fair. Yet grasped Euryalus</l>
                    <l>the blazonry at Rhamnes' corselet hung,</l>
                    <l>and belt adorned with gold: which were a gift</l>

                    <l>all bearing shields, and under the command</l>
                    <l>of Volscens. Nigh the camp and walls they drew;</l>
                    <l>and soon they spied upon the leftward path</l>
                    <l>th' heroic pair, where in dim shades of night</l>
                    <l>the helmet of Euryalus betrayed</l>
                    <l>the heedless boy, and with a glancing beam</l>
                    <l>flashed on the foe. Nor was it seen in vain.</l>
                    <l>Loud from the line the voice of Volscens called:</l>
                    <l>Stand, gentlemen! What business brings you here?</l>
                    <l>Whose your allegiance? Whither speed so fast?</l>
                    <l>No answer gave they save to fly in haste</l>
                    <l>to cover of the forest and deep gloom</l>
                    <l>of the defensive night. The horsemen then</l>
                    <l>blocked every crossway known, and, scattering wide,</l>
                    <l>kept sentry at the entrance. The great wood</l>
                    <l>was all of tangled brush and blinding shade</l>
                    <l>of flex-boughs. Impenetrable thorns</l>
                    <l>had thickly overgrown, and seldom showed</l>
                    <l>a pathway through the maze. Euryalus,</l>
                    <l>by the black branches and his ponderous spoil</l>
                    <l>impeded, groped along in fearful doubt,</l>
                    <l>deceived and quite astray. Nisus his friend</l>
                    <l>had quit him, and incautiously had forced</l>
                    <l>a sally through the close-encircling foe,</l>
                    <l>into that region which should after bear</l>
                    <l>the name of Albaa rude shelter then</l>
                    <l>for King Latinus' herds. He stayed him there</l>
                    <l>and looked, but vainly, for the comrade gone.</l>
                    <l>Euryalus, ill-fated boy! he cried,</l>
                    <l>Where have I lost thee in the pathless wild?</l>
                    <l>How find thee? How retrace the blinding maze</l>
                    <l>of yonder treacherous wood? Yet ere he said,</l>
                    <l>on his own path he turns him back, and scans</l>
                    <l>his own light footprints through the tangled thorn,</l>
                    <l>so dark and still. But suddenly he hears</l>
                    <l>the tread of horses, with confusing din</l>
                    <l>and tumult of pursuit. Nor was it long</l>
                    <l>he tarried ere upon his anguished ear</l>
                    <l>smote a great cry: and, lo! Euryalus,</l>
                    <l>trapped by the dark night, the deceptive ground,</l>
                    <l>faced the whole onset, and fell back o'erwhelmed</l>
                    <l>by a loud mob of foes, while his sole sword</l>
                    <l>tried many a thrust in vain. O, what defence</l>
                    <l>may Nisus bring? With what audacious arms</l>
                    <l>his chosen comrade save? Shall he make bare</l>
                    <l>his dying breast to all their swords, and run</l>
                    <l>to honorable death that bloody way?</l>
                    <l>he swung his spear with lifted arm, then looked</l>
                    <l>to the still moon, in heaven, and thus implored:</l>
                    <l>O goddess, aid me in my evil case.</l>
                    <l>O glory of the stars, Latona's child!</l>
                    <l>O guardian of groves, if in my name</l>
                    <l>my father Hyrtacus made offerings</l>
                    <l>on burning altars, if my own right hand,</l>
                    <l>successful in the chase, ere hung its gift</l>
                    <l>beneath thy dome or on thy sacred wall,</l>
                    <l>grant me yon troop to scatter. Guide my spear</l>
                    <l>along its path in air. He spoke, and hurled</l>
                    <l>with all his gathered strength the shaft of steel.</l>
                    <l>the swift spear clove the shades of night, and struck</l>
                    <l>full in the back of Sulmo, where it split,</l>
                    <l>but tore through to his very heart. The breast</l>
                    <l>poured forth life's glowing stream, and he, o'erthrown</l>
                    <l>lay cold in death, while his huge, heaving sides</l>
                    <l>gave lingering throes. The men about him stared </l>
                    <l>this way and that. But Nisus, fiercer still,</l>
                    <l>poised level with his ear a second shaft,</l>
                    <l>and, while the foeman paused, the whizzing spear </l>
                    <l>straight through the brows of Tagus drove, and clung</l>
                    <l>deep in the cloven brain. </l>

                <lg n="420" synch="420-445">
                    <l>In frenzy rose</l>
                    <l>Volscens, but nowhere could espy what hand</l>
                    <l>the shaft had hurled, nor whither his wild rage</l>
                    <l>could make reply. But thou, he cried, shalt feed</l>
                    <l>with thy hot blood my honor and revenge</l>
                    <l>for both the slain. Then with a sword unsheathed</l>
                    <l>upon Euryalus he fell. Loud shrieked</l>
                    <l>Nisus, of reason reft, who could not bear</l>
                    <l>such horror, nor in sheltering gloom of night</l>
                    <l>longer abide: 'T is I, 't is I! he said.</l>
                    <l>look on the man who slew them! Draw on me</l>
                    <l>your swords, Rutulians! The whole stratagem</l>
                    <l>was mine, mine only, and the lad ye slay</l>
                    <l>dared not, and could not. O, by Heaven above</l>
                    <l>and by the all-beholding stars I swear,</l>
                    <l>he did but love his hapless friend too well.</l>
                    <l>But while he spoke, the furious-thrusting sword</l>
                    <l>had pierced the tender body, and run through</l>
                    <l>the bosom white as snow. Euryalus</l>
                    <l>sank prone in death; upon his goodly limbs</l>
                    <l>the life-blood ran unstopped, and low inclined</l>
                    <l>the drooping head; as when some purpled flower,</l>
                    <l>cut by the ploughshare, dies, or poppies proud</l>
                    <l>with stem forlorn their ruined beauty bow</l>
                    <l>before the pelting storm. Then Nisus flew</l>
                    <l>straight at his foes; but in their throng would find</l>
                    <l>Volscens alone, for none but Volscens stayed:</l>
                    <l>they gathered thickly round and grappled him</l>
                    <l>in shock of steel with steel. But on he plunged,</l>
                    <l>swinging in ceaseless circles round his head</l>
                    <l>his lightning-sword, and thrust it through the face</l>
                    <l>of shrieking Volscens, with his own last breath</l>
                    <l>striking his foeman down; then cast himself</l>
                    <l>upon his fallen comrade's breast; and there,</l>
                    <l>stabbed through, found tranquil death and sure repose. </l>

                    <l>the crafty Teucrians down the rampart roll</l>

                    <l>Nor may the bold Rutulian longer hope</l>

                    <l>A tower was there, well-placed and looming large,</l>
                    <l>with many a lofty bridge, which desperately</l>
                    <l>th' Italians strove to storm, and strangely plied</l>
                    <l>besieging enginery to cast it down:</l>
                    <l>the Trojans hurled back stones, or, standing close,</l>
                    <l>flung through the loopholes a swift shower of spears.</l>
                    <l>But Turnus launched a firebrand, and pierced</l>
                    <l>the wooden wall with flame, which in the wind</l>
                    <l>leaped larger, and devoured from floor to floor,</l>
                    <l>burning each beam away. The trembling guards</l>
                    <l>sought flight in vain; and while they crowded close</l>
                    <l>into the side unkindled yet, the tower</l>
                    <l>bowed its whole weight and fell, with sudden crash</l>
                    <l>that thundered through the sky. Along the ground</l>
                    <l>half dead the warriors fell (the crushing mass</l>
                    <l>piled over them) by their own pointed spears</l>
                    <l>pierced to the heart, or wounded mortally</l>
                    <l>by cruel splinters of the wreck. Two men,</l>
                    <l>Helenor one, and Lyeus at his side,</l>
                    <l>alone get free. Helenor of the twain</l>
                    <l>was a mere youth; the slave Lycymnia</l>
                    <l>bore him in secret to the Lydian King,</l>
                    <l>and, arming him by stealth, had sent away</l>
                    <l>to serve the Trojan cause. One naked sword</l>
                    <l>for arms had he, and on his virgin shield</l>
                    <l>no blazon of renown; but when he saw</l>
                    <l>the hosts of Turnus front him, and the lines</l>
                    <l>this way and that of Latins closing round, </l>
                    <l>as a fierce, forest-creature, brought to bay</l>
                    <l>in circling pack of huntsmen, shows its teeth</l>
                    <l>against the naked spears, and scorning death</l>
                    <l>leaps upward on the javelins,even so,</l>
                    <l>not loth to die, the youthful soldier flew</l>
                    <l>straight at the centre of his foes, and where</l>
                    <l>the shining swords looked thickest, there he sprung.</l>
                    <l>But Lyeus, swifter-footed, forced his way</l>
                    <l>past the opposing spears and made escape</l>
                    <l>far as the ciity-wall, where he would fain</l>
                    <l>clutch at the coping and climb up to clasp</l>
                    <l>some friend above: but Turnus, spear in hand,</l>
                    <l>had hotly followed, and exulting loud</l>
                    <l>thus taunted him, Hadst thou the hope, rash fool,</l>
                    <l>beyond this grasp to fly? So, as he clung,</l>
                    <l>he tore him down; and with him broke and fell</l>
                    <l>a huge piece of the wall: not otherwise</l>
                    <l>a frail hare, or a swan of snow-white wing,</l>

                    <l>from bleating mother and the broken fold</l>
                    <l>is stolen by the wolf of Mars. Wild shouts</l>
                    <l>on every side resound. In closer siege</l>
                    <l>the foe press on, and heap the trenches full,</l>
                    <l>or hurl hot-flaming torches at the towers.</l>
                    <l>Ilioneus with mountain-mass of stone</l>
                    <l>struck down Lucetius, as he crept with fire</l>
                    <l>too near the city-gate. Emathion fell</l>
                    <l>by Liger's hand, and Corynteus' death</l>
                    <l>Asilas dealt: one threw the javelin well;</l>
                    <l>th' insidious arrow was Asilas' skill.</l>
                    <l>Ortygius was slain by Caeneus, then</l>
                    <l>victorious Geneus fell by Turnus' ire.</l>
                    <l>Then smote he Dioxippus, and laid low</l>
                    <l>Itys and Promolus and Sagaris</l>
                    <l>and Clonius, and from the lofty tower</l>
                    <l>shot Idas down. The shaft of Capys pierced</l>
                    <l>Privernus, whom Themilla's javelin</l>

                    <l>casting his shield far from him, had outspread</l>
                    <l>his left hand on the wound: then sudden flew</l>
                    <l>the feathered arrow, and the hand lay pinned</l>
                    <l>against his left side, while the fatal barb</l>
                    <l>was buried in his breathing life. The son</l>
                    <l>of Arcens now stood forth in glittering arms.</l>
                    <l>His broidered cloak was red Iberian stain,</l>
                    <l>and beautiful was he. Arcens his sire</l>
                    <l>had sent him to the war; but he was bred</l>
                    <l>in a Sicilian forest by a stream</l>
                    <l>to his nymph-mother dear, where rose the shrine</l>
                    <l>of merciful Palicus, blest and fair.</l>
                    <l>But, lo! Mezentius his spear laid by,</l>
                    <l>and whirled three times about his head the thong</l>
                    <l>of his loud sling: the leaden bullet clove</l>
                    <l>the youth's mid-forehead, and his towering form</l>
                    <l>fell prostrate its full length along the ground.</l>

                    <l>to home and native land. Yet would the King</l>

                    <l>Now Turnus' goddess-sister bids him haste</l>
                    <l>to Lausus' help. So he, in wheeling car,</l>
                    <l>cut through the lines; and when his friends he saw,</l>
                    <l>Let the fight stop!  he cried, for none but I</l>
                    <l>may strike at Pallas; unto me alone</l>
                    <l>the prize of Pallas falls. I would his sire</l>
                    <l>stood by to see. He spake: his troop withdrew</l>
                    <l>a fitting space. But as they made him room,</l>
                    <l>the young prince, wondering at the scornful words,</l>
                    <l>looked upon Turnus, glancing up and down</l>
                    <l>that giant frame, and with fierce-frowning brows</l>
                    <l>scanned him from far, hurling defiant words</l>
                    <l>in answer to the King's. My honor now</l>
                    <l>shall have the royal trophy of this war,</l>
                    <l>or glorious death. For either fortune fair</l>
                    <l>my sire is ready. Threaten me no more!</l>
                    <l>So saying, to the midmost space he strode,</l>
                    <l>and in Arcadian hearts the blood stood still.</l>
                    <l>Swift from his chariot Turnus leaped, and ran</l>
                    <l>to closer fight. As when some lion sees</l>
                    <l>from his far mountain-lair a raging bull</l>
                    <l>that sniffs the battle from the grassy field,</l>

                    <l>within a spear's cast, Pallas opened fight,</l>
                    <l>expecting Fortune's favor to the brave</l>
                    <l>in such unequal match; and thus he prayed:</l>
                    <l>O, by my hospitable father's roof,</l>
                    <l>where thou didst enter as a stranger-guest,</l>
                    <l>hear me, Alcides, and give aid divine</l>
                    <l>to this great deed. Let Turnus see these hands</l>
                    <l>strip from his half-dead breast the bloody spoil!</l>
                    <l>and let his eyes in death endure to see</l>
                    <l>his conqueror! Alcides heard the youth:</l>
                    <l>but prisoned in his heart a deep-drawn sigh,</l>
                    <l>and shed vain tears; for Jove, the King and Sire, .</l>
                    <l>spoke with benignant accents to his son:</l>

                    <l>man's little time runs by: but to prolong</l>
                    <l>life's glory by great deeds is virtue's power.</l>

                    <l>is summoned to his doom, and nears the bounds</l>
                    <l>of his appointed span. So speaking, Jove</l>
                    <l>turned from Rutulia's war his eyes away.</l>
                    <l>But Pallas hurled his lance with might and main,</l>
                    <l>and from its hollow scabbard flashed his sword.</l>
                    <l>The flying shaft touched where the plated steel</l>
                    <l>over the shoulders rose, and worked its way</l>
                    <l>through the shield's rimthen falling, glanced aside</l>

                    <l>poised, without haste, his iron-pointed spear,</l>
                    <l>and, launching it on Pallas, cried, Look now</l>
                    <l>will not this shaft a good bit deeper drive?</l>
                    <l>He said: and through the mid-boss of the shield,</l>
                    <l>steel scales and brass with bull's-hide folded round,</l>
                    <l>the quivering spear-point crashed resistlessly,</l>
                    <l>and through the corselet's broken barrier</l>
                    <l>pierced Pallas' heart. The youth plucked out in vain</l>
                    <l>the hot shaft from the wound; his life and blood</l>
                    <l>together ebbed away, as sinking prone</l>

                    <l>his Pallas I restore, and freely grant</l>

                    <l>So saying, with his left foot he held down</l>
                    <l>the lifeless form, and raised the heavy weight</l>

                    <l>in prosperous days! To Turnus comes the hour</l>

                    <l>had Pallas passed unscathed, and will bewail</l>

                    <l>in the left groin; then from the chariot fallen,</l>
                    <l>the youth rolled dying on the field, while thus</l>
                    <l>pious Aeneas paid him taunting words:</l>
                    <l>O Lucagus, thy chariot did not yield</l>
                    <l>because of horses slow to fly, or scared</l>
                    <l>by shadows of a foe. It was thyself</l>
                    <l>leaped o'er the wheel and fled. So saying, he grasped</l>
                    <l>the horses by the rein. The brother then,</l>
                    <l>spilled also from the car, reached wildly forth</l>
                    <l>his helpless hands: O, by thy sacred head,</l>
                    <l>and by the parents who such greatness gave,</l>
                    <l>good Trojan, let me live! Some pity show</l>
                    <l>to prostrate me! But ere he longer sued,</l>
                    <l>Aeneas cried, Not so thy language ran</l>
                    <l>a moment gone! Die thou! Nor let this day</l>
                    <l>brother from brother part! Then where the life</l>
                    <l>hides in the bosom, he thrust deep his sword.</l>
                    <l>Thus o'er the field of war the Dardan King</l>
                    <l>moved on, death-dealing: like a breaking flood</l>
                    <l>or cloudy whirlwind seemed his wrath. Straightway</l>
                    <l>the boy Ascanius from the ramparts came,</l>
                    <l>his warriors with him; for the siege had failed.</l>

                    <l>Juno made meek reply: O noblest spouse!</l>
                    <l>Why vex one sick at heart, who humbly fears</l>
                    <l>thy stern command? If I could claim to-day</l>

                    <l>with eyes uprolled, and gasping as he gave</l>
                    <l>long looks at heaven, recalled his fading mind:</l>
                    <l>Why frown at me and fume, O bitterest foe?</l>
                    <l>Why threaten death? To slay me is no sin.</l>
                    <l>Not to take quarter came I to this war,</l>
                    <l>not truce with thee did my lost Lausus crave,</l>
                    <l>yet this one boon I pray,if mercy be</l>
                    <l>for fallen foes: O, suffer me when dead</l>
                    <l>in covering earth to hide! Full well I know</l>
                    <l>what curses of my people ring me round.</l>
                    <l>Defend me from that rage! I pray to be</l>
                    <l>my son's companion in our common tomb.</l>
                    <l>He spoke: then offered with unshrinking eye</l>
                    <l>his veined throat to the sword. O'er the bright mail</l>
                    <l>his vital breath gushed forth in streaming gore.</l>

                    <l>shorn of its limbs he sets upon a hill</l>
                    <l>and clothes it o'er with glittering arms, the spoil</l>

                    <l>the smooth young breast that bore the gaping wound</l>
                    <l>of that Ausonian spear, and weeping said:</l>

                    <l>Evander, when with friendly, fond embrace</l>

                    <l>Some busy them to build of osiers fine</l>

                    <l>as if on shepherd's couch, the youthful dead,</l>
                    <l>like fairest flower by virgin fingers culled,</l>

                    <l>two broidered robes of scarlet and fine gold,</l>
                    <l>which with the gladsome labor of her hands</l>

                    <l>the thin-spun gold inweaving. One of these</l>
                    <l>the sad prince o'er the youthful body threw</l>
                    <l>for parting gift; and with the other veiled</l>
                    <l>those tresses from the fire; he heaped on high</l>
                    <l>Laurentum's spoils of war, and bade to bring</l>
                    <l>much tribute forth: horses and arms he gave,</l>
                    <l>seized from the fallen enemy; with hands</l>
                    <l>fettered behind them filed a captive train</l>

                    <l>to mix their flowing blood. He bade his chiefs</l>
                    <l>set up the trunks of trees and clothe them well</l>
                    <l>with captured arms, inscribing on each one</l>
                    <l>some foeman's name. Then came Acoetes forth,</l>

                    <l>with ruthless fingers; oft he cast him down</l>
                    <l>full length along the ground. Then lead they forth</l>
                    <l>the blood-stained Rutule chariots of war;</l>
                    <l>Aethon, the war-horse, of his harness bare,</l>

                    <l>victorious Turnus seized. Then filed along</l>
                    <l>a mournful Teucrian cohort; next the host</l>
                    <l>Etrurian and the men of Arcady</l>
                    <l>with trailing arms reversed. Aeneas now,</l>

                    <l>he clung to the pale corse with tears, with groans,</l>

                    <l>of youth so fair! O prelude pitiless</l>
                    <l>of war approaching! O my vows and prayers,</l>

                    <l>by living longer lived to meet my doom,</l>

                    <l>O Latins, as I urged. It is no time</l>

                    <l>by the huntsman's grievous thrust, awakens him</l>
                    <l>unto his last grim fight, and gloriously</l>

                    <l>On his own terms I come. Bring forward, sire,</l>
                    <l>the sacrifice, and seal the pact I swear:</l>

                    <l>Recall your martial rage! The pledge is given</l>

                    <l>the margin of his plume. Then burst his rage:</l>

                    <l>Now by the war-god's favor he began</l>

                    <l>a bitter-leaved wild-olive, once had grown,</l>
                    <l>to Faunus dear, and venerated oft</l>

                    <l>But, heeding not, the Teucrians had shorn</l>
                    <l>the stem away, to clear the field for war.</l>
                    <l>'T was here Aeneas' lance stuck fast; its speed</l>

                    <l>the swift out-speeding foe. But Turnus then,</l>
                    <l>bewildered and in terror, cried aloud:</l>
                    <l>O Faunus, pity me and heed my prayer!</l>
                    <l>Hold fast his weapon, O benignant Earth!</l>
                    <l>If ere these hands have rendered offering due,</l>
                    <l>where yon polluting Teucrians fight and slay.</l>
                    <l>He spoke; invoking succor of the god,</l>
                    <l>with no Iost prayer. For tugging valiantly</l>
                    <l>and laboring long against the stubborn stem,</l>
                    <l>Aeneas with his whole strength could but fail</l>
                    <l>to Ioose the clasping tree. While fiercely thus</l>
                    <l>he strove and strained, Juturna once again,</l>

                    <l>herself came near, and plucked from that deep root</l>
                    <l>the javelin forth. So both with lofty mien</l>
                    <l>strode forth new-armed, new-hearted: one made bold</l>
                    <l>by his good sword, the other, spear in hand,</l>
                    <l>uptowered in wrath, and with confronting brows</l>

                    <l>But come, relinquish thy rash, fruitless rage:</l>
                    <l>I give thee this desire, and yield to thee</l>
                    <l>free submission. The Ausonian tribes</l>
                    <l>shall keep the speech and customs of their sires;</l>
                    <l>the name remains as now; the Teucrian race,</l>

                    <l>the mixture of its blood. I will bestow</l>
                    <l>a league of worship, and to Latins give</l>
                    <l>one language only. From the mingled breed</l>

                    <l>then at the town he glares, shrinks back in fear,</l>
                    <l>and trembles at th' impending lance; nor sees</l>
                    <l>what path to fly, what way confront the foe:</l>
                    <l>no chariot now, nor sister-charioteer!</l>
                </lg>
                <lg n="919" synch="919-952">
                    <l>Above his faltering terror gleams in air</l>
                    <l>Aeneas' fatal spear; whose eye perceived</l>
                    <l>the moment of success, and all whose strength</l>
                    <l>struck forth: the vast and ponderous rock outflung</l>
                    <l>from engines which make breach in sieged walls</l>
                    <l>not louder roars nor breaks in thunder-sound</l>
                    <l>more terrible; like some black whirlwind flew</l>
                    <l>the death-delivering spear, and, rending wide</l>
                    <l>the corselet's edges and the heavy rim</l>
                    <l>of the last circles of the seven-fold shield,</l>
                    <l>pierced, hissing, through the thigh. Huge Turnus sinks</l>
                    <l>o'erwhelmed upon the ground with doubling knee.</l>
                    <l>Up spring the Rutules, groaning; the whole hill</l>
                    <l>roars answering round them, and from far and wide</l>
                    <l>the lofty groves give back an echoing cry.</l>
                    <l>Lowly, with suppliant eyes, and holding forth</l>
                    <l>his hand in prayer: I have my meed, he cried,</l>
                    <l>Nor ask for mercy. Use what Fate has given!</l>
                    <l>But if a father's grief upon thy heart</l>
                    <l>have power at all,for Sire Anchises once</l>
                    <l>to thee was dear,I pray thee to show grace</l>
                    <l>to Daunus in his desolate old age;</l>
                    <l>and me, or, if thou wilt, my lifeless clay,</l>
                    <l>to him and his restore. For, lo, thou art</l>
                    <l>my conqueror! Ausonia's eyes have seen</l>
                    <l>me suppliant, me fallen. Thou hast made</l>
                    <l>Lavinia thy bride. Why further urge</l>
                    <l>our enmity?With swift and dreadful arms</l>
                    <l>Aeneas o'er him stood, with rolling eyes,</l>
                    <l>but his bare sword restraining; for such words</l>
                    <l>moved on him more and more: when suddenly,</l>
                    <l>over the mighty shoulder slung, he saw</l>
                    <l>that fatal baldric studded with bright gold</l>
                    <l>which youthful Pallas wore, what time he fell</l>
                    <l>vanquished by Turnus' stroke, whose shoulders now</l>
                    <l>carried such trophy of a foeman slain.</l>
                    <l>Aeneas' eyes took sure and slow survey</l>
                    <l>of spoils that were the proof and memory</l>
                    <l>of cruel sorrow; then with kindling rage</l>
                    <l>and terrifying look, he cried, Wouldst thou,</l>
                    <l>clad in a prize stripped off my chosen friend,</l>
                    <l>escape this hand? In this thy mortal wound</l>
                    <l>'t is Pallas has a victim; Pallas takes</l>
                    <l>the lawful forfeit of thy guilty blood!</l>
                    <l>He said, and buried deep his furious blade</l>
                    <l>in the opposer's heart. The failing limbs</l>
                    <l>sank cold and helpless; and the vital breath </l>
                    <l>with moan of wrath to darkness fled away.</l>
